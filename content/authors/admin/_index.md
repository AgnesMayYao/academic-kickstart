I am currently working as a PhD student at Daily Activity Lab at the University of Texas at Austin.

a PhD student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering The University of Texas at Austin
Daily Activily Lab at Institute of Mental Health Reaserch

research: human signals, stress signals from mother-infant pairs, daily activities
longitudinal data, noisy dataset, wearable sensors, individual differences
experiece with motion and audio sensors, developed algorithm for holding behaviro detection, audi classifcation, vocal tone

access the basic mechanisms of maternal mental health and infant social-emotional development, and ultimately to develop “just in time” interventions for cases of high risk, such as the transmission of risks for depression from mothers to infants.
